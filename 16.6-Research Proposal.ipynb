    "How to help people sleep better? Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout our life. Getting enough quality sleep at the right times can help protect our mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety. Currently, supplement A is widely used by people, however, not all users find it's effective."

    "We will randomly select 100 people who takes supplement to sleep. And then randomly assign these subjects into two groups. The control group takes supplement A every day and the treatment group takes supplement B every day. The variable of interest is quality of sleep. This is an A/B manupulation where taking supplement A or taking supplement B. \n",
    "\n",
    "Testing will be conducted for a month. Quality of sleep will be measured daily with a survey that is composed of five-point Likert scale items. e.g., Rate your sleep last night: 0: very bad, 1: bad, 2: okay, 3: good, 4: very good. We will compute an average score for each subject over the 30 day period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run a wo sample t-test to test the difference between two groups. If there is a significant difference and the mean of (treatment group - control group) is positive. We can conclude that take supplement B is more effective than supplement A. "
